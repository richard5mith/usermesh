TODO
====

Things I plan on working on next, in not necessarily this order...

- Splitting up the templates in the skin more, to allow more design flexibility, headers/footers etc.
- Settings screen
- Skin chooser
- Breadcrumbs in admin
- Letting you set the nice url from the post page, rather than the filename (why would you care what the filename is?)
- Let you run importers, static generation from within the admin
- Automatically generate the new static when you update a post
- Post preview
- Category admin
- Image management
- Visitor stats
- Fix tab highlights
- Show number of items in a list
- Text filtering, for source code highlighting (which is partially there) and other things like that
- Easy way to drop in your Google analytics code into a skin without editing the skin
- Site titles, subtitle, about us etc dropins to a skin, editable from control panel
- Importers homepage with stats on imported items
- New plugin for Static pages, like an "about me" page or a homepage which isn't your blog
- Documentation. Lots and lots of documentation
- Installation script
- Auto-updater to latest version
- The function that draws the map should be a helper in Helper.pm, not a function of Usermesh.pm
- There's a lot of confusion in the code over whether $self is the app, the current request, or the current object. So the design pattern is wrong.
- An alternative visual post editor instead of raw Markdown, but I just don't like anything I've found so far
- Show a progress bar when you drag and drop an image into the text area and it's uploading
- A post type of review, where you can enter an Amazon ASIN, and it pulls the details from Amazon as a header/footer for your content
- Option for posting to Facebook / Twitter when you create a new blog post

FUTURE IMPORTERS
